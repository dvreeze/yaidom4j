/**
 * Concrete yaidom4j element implementations, implementing the abstract query API and/or transformation
 * API in packages {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.queryapi} and {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.transformationapi}, respectively.
 * <p>
 * This package and its subpackages directly depend on the {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.queryapi},
 * {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.transformationapi} and {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.jaxp} Java packages.
 * <p>
 * The {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.dom.clark} subpackage does not depend on the other {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.dom}
 * subpackages. The {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.dom.immutabledom} subpackage depends on the
 * {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.dom.clark} subpackage, due to conversions to "Clark nodes". Similarly, the
 * {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.dom.ancestryaware} subpackage depends both on the {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.dom.clark}
 * and {@link eu.cdevreeze.yaidom4j.dom.immutabledom} subpackages.
